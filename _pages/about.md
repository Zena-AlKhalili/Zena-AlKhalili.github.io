I'm a PhD student in the department of Language Science and Technology at Saarland University and a member of Saarland Informatics Campus. I work in the [Spoken Language Systems](https://www.lsv.uni-saarland.de/) group, advised by [Prof. Dr. Dietrich Klakow](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=_HtGYmoAAAAJ&hl=de).
I'm also an associate member at the [Research Training Group](https://www.neuroexplicit.org/) focusing on Neuroexplicit models.
My research interest lies in Natural Language Processing with a focus on studying reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models.

Previously, I have obtained a master degree in Language Science and Technology from Saarland university, and a bachelor degree in Information Technology Engineering from Damascus University. 

You can reach me in person at Saarland University,
Saarbrücken campus 66123, Building C7.1, office 0.14.
